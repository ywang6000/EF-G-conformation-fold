This repository contains the computational workflows and analysis code supporting the paper titled:  
*Evolutionary Insights into Elongation Factor G Using AlphaFold and Ancestral Analysis*.  
**Comput Biol Med 2025 Vol. 191 Pages 110188; Accession Number: 40222265 DOI: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110188

## Overview

This project integrates structural prediction, phylogenetic analysis, and functional validation to explore EF-G conformational evolution. Specifically, it covers:

- Identification of EF-G conformations (con1 vs. con2) using AlphaFold predictions.
- Clustering of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) based on AlphaFold-predicted structures.
- Phylogenetic reconstruction and ancestral sequence inference.
- Functional and biophysical characterization of two reconstructed ancestral EF-G proteins.

## Key Tools and Dependencies
- myenv.yml
- requirement.txt
- **AlphaFold / ColabFold** — for structure prediction  
- **IQ-TREE 2** — for maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction  
- **PyMOL** — for structural visualization and comparison  
- **Biopython**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib** — for parsing, analysis, and plotting

## modularity
Most cells function as modular units, capable of carrying out specific tasks independently. 

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the computing environment:
```bash
conda env create -f myenv.yml
conda activate myenv  
```
To reproduce the full analysis pipeline:

1. Set your working directory (`default_path`).
2. Start from **cell #2** in `EF-G_folding.ipynb`, adjusting the path to your local ColabFold installation.
3. Run **cell #3** to generate the `Cluster/` directory.
4. Follow through cells #2–8 to reproduce Figures 1–2.  
   Cells #9–16 generate Figure 3, and #18–22 produce Figure 5.  
5. Cell #23 (standalone) uses Logomaker for Figure 4.  
6. Cell #17 produces Supplementary Figure S4A.
